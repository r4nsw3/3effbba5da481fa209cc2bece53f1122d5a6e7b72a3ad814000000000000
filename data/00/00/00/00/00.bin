  |   In Apocalipsis: Harry at the End of the World you play as Harry,      |
  |   for whom the loss of his beloved was the end of his world. Now he     |
  |   has to venture out into the strange, unwelcoming and haunted lands    |
  |   to get her back. On his journey he will meet fantastical creatures,   |
  |   straight from the visions of the 15th and 16th artists such as Hans   |
  |   Holbein or Albrecht DÃ¼rer. In Apocalipsis the static woodcuts of      |
  |   old start living their own life, they form a whole new world          |
  |   inspired by the Book of Revelation and the aesthetic of Danse         |
  |   Macabre - a world filled with dread, death, and disease. Yet, there   |
  |   is still a space for true love in these sinister lands...             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The medieval philosophy and occult symbolism go beyond the visuals    |
  |   and inspire the story itself. In this game the music and the          |
  |   graphics work in perfect tandem to immerse you in this bizzare,       |
  |   dreary world. Wormwood Edition also contains "One Night in the        |
  |   Woods", which is a prequel to the story known from Apocalipsis:       |
  |   Harry at the End of the World.                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Apocalipsis: Harry at the End of the World is also the first          |
  |   appearance of the best-selling black metal band, Behemoth, in the     |
  |   world of video games. With Behemoth's music hidden in gameplay and    |
  |   Nergal (the ominous leader of the band) narrating, it's one hell of   |
  |   an experience!                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
